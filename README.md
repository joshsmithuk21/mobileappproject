# Chittr - Mobile Application Assignment

In this project I have designed a fully working front end application for a twitter duplicated named Chittr. This application has been created as part of my university third year.

## Getting Started

Welcome to my README File that will aid in your installation and use of my Mobile Applications Coursework for my Final Year!  

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the react native application there are a few applications I would suggest installing first and they are as follows:

  1) Android Studios,
  2) ATOM ,
  3) Chittr Webserver
  4) Node.js Command Line Interface


Once all the above files are installed and fully functioning you can now following the 'Installing' section of this README file.


### Installing

Before downloading the application you MUST follow the 'Prerequisites' section of this README file first!
1) Download Zip File From Github,
2) Extract Zip file,
3) Go to the directory using the NPM Comandline
4) Then type npx react-native run-android
5) The application should then start booting up

## Running the tests

This project is set up to use [jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for tests. Jest is the recommended testing platform by my university and is why we're using this way of testing.. Create test files in directories called `__tests__` or with the `.test` extension to have the files loaded by jest. See the [the template project](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/App.test.js) for an example test. The [jest documentation](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html) is also a wonderful resource, as is the [React Native testing tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/tutorial-react-native.html).

### Break down into end to end tests



## What is React Native?

"React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities." 'Source - Facebook (2020)  https://reactnative.dev/

## Updating

You should only need to update the global installation of create-react-native-app very rarely, ideally never.
Updating the react-native-scripts dependency on the app is as simple as updating version numbers in package.json and reinstalling your project's dependencies using npm install when within the project directory. Upgrading to a new version of React Native requires updating the react-native, react, and expo package versions, and setting the correct sdkVersion in app.json. See the versioning guide for up-to-date information about package version compatibility.

## Versioning

  I have created branches at each pinnacle point of my application in order for rollback in order things were to go horribly wrong during my coding experience.
